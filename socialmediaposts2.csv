Courtney Lanning,"On every level, it's a set of cinematic genius. The craft is expertly made, and it shows in every shot, every note of the [score], and every scene that transports the audience to Arrakis.","Mar 13, 2024"
tt stern-enzi,"This was the best adaptation of a book that I've ever seen.","Mar 12, 2024"
Jorge Cotte,"The film warns us against the very thing it gives us. We watch from reclining chairs as Paul starts a holy war—our hands are clean. We get the heroic battles and the guilt on the side. Our hero is tortured so we don’t have to be.","Mar 12, 2024"
Paul Salfen,"An incredible sci-fi epic that well surpasses the first part and achieves on every level. This might be the best sci-fi film we've had in many years and will likely be one of the best films of the year.","Mar 12, 2024"
Joshua Tyler,"Dune feels without tears. Dune speaks without words.","Mar 12, 2024"
Rubén Rosario,"Toppled by arid self-importance.","Mar 11, 2024"
Jackie K. Cooper,"Epic visually, but the story is still hard to follow if you have not read the book.","Mar 11, 2024"
Tim Brennan,"Dune: Part Two is a singular vision painted on an enormous cinematic canvas. See it on the biggest screen you can.","Mar 11, 2024"
Víctor López G.,"With his second foray into Frank Herbert's universe, Denis Villeneuve has once again crafted a cinematic juggernaut designed to be seen on the biggest screen and heard through the most powerful sound system possible.","Mar 11, 2024"
CJ Sheu,"Denis Villeneuve uses Dune: Part Two (2024), cowritten with Jon Spaihts, to examine the experience of being set before the prophecy, knowing you’re its intended subject. [... T]his narrative structure is famously hinted at in the Gospels.","Mar 11, 2024"
Robert Roten,"The genius of the author, Herbert, and now the director, Villeneuve, is to weave all this complexity into an easily understood, and compelling story. It's been tried before, but this is the first time it has really worked.","Mar 10, 2024"
MaryAnn Johanson,"Ugly, outrageous, brutal, and cynical; a genuinely terrifying film about power and politics as religion and control. There is little escapism here; hits square in the social plexus of horrifying 2024.","Mar 9, 2024"
Joe Friar,"Like George Lucas and Ridley Scott, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve proves himself a visionary by delivering one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.","Mar 9, 2024"
Tim Brayton,"Where it really comes into its own as a hugely satisfying Hollywood sci-fi epic is in the action-adventure material, which is also backloaded, so the very long film seems to keep getting bigger and richer as it goes along.","Mar 9, 2024"
Rebecca Cusey,"[Dune 2] owes its intellectual interest to Herbert’s books. Is faith merely another resource to be exploited in the quest for power? ... Or is it real, tapping into a true well of knowledge and sustenance? The Dune series asks but doesn’t try to answer.","Mar 9, 2024"
Chris Klimek,"Grains of sand, not pixels, give Denis Villeneuve's spectacle its potent spice, in this urgent and compelling conclusion.","Mar 9, 2024"
Walter Chaw,"Like its predecessor, Dune Part Two is gorgeously filmed and prodigiously imagined.","Mar 9, 2024"
Margot Harrison,"The film's real center of gravity is its spectacle, the craft with which Villeneuve and his crew depict Herbert's stupendously complex worlds.","Mar 8, 2024"
Tony Baker,"It's impressive filmmaking.","Mar 8, 2024"
Dwight Brown,"An epic and spectacular sci-fi allegory with mass appeal.","Mar 8, 2024"
